# AB_Test_Results
Here was the project I did for the Practical Statistics unit from the Data Analyst Nanodegree through Udacity. 

The goal of this project was to look at the effect a new web page design had on the conversion rate of its users. We used a control group, the old web page, and a treatment group, the new web page. I set up hypothesis testing and analyzed the data set using a few different methods.

I had prior knowledge of these statsitcs from my course work at Kansas State University, but this unit foucsed on how to apply these statistcs to real life data and use python to run these tests.
